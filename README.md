# Simulation-Driven Multi-Agent AI Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project implements an **Agentic AI–enabled, simulation-driven multi-tier manufacturing risk management chatbot**.

The system autonomously monitors supplier inventory, detects phantom stock, predicts risk propagation across supplier tiers, and generates explainable AI decisions using OpenAI-powered agents.
